        <h3>📞 Calls</h3>
        <p>Track outbound calls daily. Set a weekly target (like 200/week) and watch your progress bar fill up. Know exactly where you stand every single day.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="feature-card">
        <h3>🗣️ Talk-Tos</h3>

        <h3>📅 Appointments</h3>
        <p>Consultations, discovery calls, pre-qual meetings. Track how many you're booking and whether you're hitting your weekly targets.</p>
